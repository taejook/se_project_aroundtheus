**Intro**
  
This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.  

**Description**
The webpage's appearance focused on responsive design techniques including media queries. It is made sure to run smoothly and  behaves as intended in the design instead of all the elements collapsing onto each other once the screen resolution changes.
  
**Figma**

**Images**  
  
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

*CSS
  
Good luck and have fun!
